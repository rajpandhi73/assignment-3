Q-3) What is the difference between OOP and POP?

--> OOP:
- it is known as Object Oriented Programming.
- its main focus is Objects and classes.
- it is organized around objects.
- modularity od OOP is high, through encapsulation and abstraction.
- data handling: Data encapsulated within objects.
- its reusability is high, through inheritance and polymorphism

--> POP:
- it is known as Procedure Oriented Programming.
- its main focus is Functions and procedures.
- it is organized around functions.
- modularity od POP is limited, as functions can be scattered in it.
- data handling: Data is often global.
- its reusability is also limited, mainly through function reuse

--> Both POP and OOP have their own strengths as both are useful in its own way.
